<p>
  Our mission is to help scientists be more productive by teaching
  them basic computing skills. Our approach combines short, intensive
  boot camps with self-paced online instruction. The benefits are more
  reliable results and higher productivity: a day a week is common,
  and a ten-fold improvement isn't rare. Can Software Carpentry help
  you?  These <a href="{{root_path}}/about/testimonials.html">testimonials</a> from former
  students can help you decide.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Boot camps</strong><br />
  Our boot camps cover the core skills needed to be productive in
  a small team: program design, version control, testing, the
  shell, and data management. Short tutorials alternate with
  hands-on practical sessions for two full days.
  See our <a href="{{root_path}}/bootcamps/index.html">list of boot camps</a>
  for upcoming dates and locations.

<p>
  <strong>Online Lessons</strong><br />
  Our <a href="{{root_path}}/4_0/index.html">video lectures</a> cover all of our
  core topics and much else as well. (The notes from Version 3 of this
  course are <a href="{{root_path}}/3_0/index.html">also available</a>.)  All of our
  <a href="{{root_path}}/about/contributing.html#develop">content</a> can be freely re-used under
  <a href="{{root_path}}/license.html">open access licenses</a>.
